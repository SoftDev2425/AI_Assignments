       "\"Apple was founded on April 1, 1976  by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in a garage in Palo Alto, California. At just 17 years old, Steve Jobs dropped  out of school after only one semester, and for a year and a half he took various courses  to find out what he would like to study. In 1974 he joined Atari as a video game programmer, where he first met Steve Wozniak. At the same time, Steve decided to travel to India  for eight months to study Buddhism. After returning from this trip, Steve Jobs worked again for Atari to create  a circuit board for the Breakout game. Also, at that time, Altair 8800 appeared, a computer that had to be assembled by customers  but with which nothing could be done. That was until Bill Gates and Paul Allen  wrote the BASIC programming language so that rudimentary calculations could be made. Steve Jobs saw this as an opportunity to make money  and turned to Steve Wozniak who had the knowledge to make a computer. But to achieve this, they needed money. So Jobs sold his car, a Volkswagen,  and Wozniak sold his HP computer. With this money, they launched Apple Computer Company  on April 1, 1976 through a partnership with Ronald Wayne. In this way, the three were able to create  Apple I computers that they sold for a year without a monitor, keyboard or case, which have been included since 1977. Later, Jobs found a way to sell computers. It has partnered with The Byte Shop to  sell 50 Apple I computers for $666.66. But, unfortunately, the three did not  have enough money to deliver the order, so they contacted a component supplier to give them a credit for 30 days, and will return the money after the order is delivered. In terms of profit, Jobs and Wozniak took 45% each, and Wayne received only 10% of the company's money. But immediately after the company was founded,  Ronald Wayne sold his 10% stake for $800. He was also the one who drew the first  Apple logo and wrote the Apple I user manual. One year after its inception, Apple Inc.  received the first investment: $92,000.  Success was guaranteed, so the Apple II  was launched, along with its own monitor,  open architecture and colorful graphics. Apple II was very successful, so Apple III was not long in coming. It was launched in 1980 in collaboration with IBM. With each passing day, the founders of Apple became millionaires. Steve Jobs became increasingly convinced that the future  belonged to computer-friendly graphical user interfaces, so in 1983 he launched the Apple Lisa, the first personal computer with a graphical interface. Subsequently, its commercialization proved to be a failure  due to the high price and the limited number of applications. Steve Wozniak also left Apple in 1983, and then Jobs put John Sculley, president  of PepsiCo, as CEO hoping to grow the company. So, in 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh 128K, which was successful, but then dropped dramatically due to the high price,  low speed and software limitations. A conflict ensued between Steve Jobs  and John Sculley over the different vision, and Steve left the company in 1985 and founded NeXT  with some of his employees. Jobs launched here the NeXTSTEP Operating System, which was later bought by Apple for 430 million dollars. At the time, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy,  when Steve Jobs returned to lead the company as CEO in 1997.  Since then, the company's fate has changed. They began development for new products, and in 1998 launched the iMac which was sold  in over 800,000 units in the first five months. In 2001, the first Apple stores were  opened in Virginia and California, Mac OS X was launched, the portable product iPod was introduced on the market, and in 2003 they launched the first  digital platform to sells music, iTunes, which is fast becoming the market leader. In 2007, Apple made the most profitable  launch in its history, the iPhone, Apple's first touchscreen phone. Given the success of the iPhone,  Apple launched in 2010 the iPad, the first tablet that could replace a computer. Unfortunately, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, Steve Jobs died in 2011, and was taken over by Tim Cook,  who had already held executive positions since 2009. Even though many believed that Steve Jobs' death would mean the end Apple  Tim Cook has proven that Apple can thrive financially and bring completely new and revolutionary products to market. In 2011, he launched the Siri virtual assistant, and in 2015 he launched the Apple Watch. Right now, Apple is among the most valuable companies in the world, the company's net value at the end of 2020 was $ 65.34 billion,  and its market capitalization is $ 2.08 trillion as of March 15, 2021. Now, finding out what Apple's past was and  knowing where the company is now positioned, some compare it to a religion because it  is not a single product or a single person. Thanks for watching!

       " 'summary': 'Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\\nFor most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024. In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion. As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company\\'s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs\\'s return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors\\' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world\\'s most valuable brands.\\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.',\n",

Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\\nFor most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024. In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion. As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company\\'s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs\\'s return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors\\' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world\\'s most valuable brands.\\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022.

Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company\\'s interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.\\nWith the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop \"Computer\" from the company\\'s name in 2007.
